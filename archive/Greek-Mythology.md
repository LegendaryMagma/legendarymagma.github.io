**HOW EVERYTHING STARTED**

The Ancient Greeks believed that in the beginning, the world was in a state of nothingness which they called Chaos. Suddenly, from light, came Gaia (Mother Earth) and from her came Uranus (the sky) along with other old gods (called primordials) like Pontus (the primordial god of the oceans). Gaia and Uranus had 12 children, the Titans. The most important of the 12 children were Kronos and Rhea.

Gaia gave birth to some monsters called cyclops and the hundred handed ones. Uranus disgusted by the monsters threw them in Tartarus. Gaia, angered by Uranus, sought revenge on Uranus. Gaia used her son Kronos, who chopped off Uranus’ genitals. Kronos threw Uranus into the ocean. From the blood of his genitals, came the goddess of love and beauty—Aphrodite.

Kronos married his sister Rhea and gave birth to 6 children, who were called the gods. Kronos, who was afraid of a prophecy delivered to him a while ago (which stated that one day his children would cut him up), swallowed each of his children each time they were born.

Rhea did not like this, so she saved Zeus and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. Zeus was raised by a goat named Amaltheia, in a mountain cave located in Crete. When Zeus was old enough, he tricked Kronos into drinking a mixture of wine and mustard. Kronos vomited up the rest of the gods, who, being immortal, had been growing up completely undigested in Kronos’ stomach. Zeus and other gods then had a big war with the Titans. Zeus won with the help of the hundred handed ones and the cyclops. After they won the war Zeus cut Kronos into pieces and threw them into Tartarus.

**THE TWELVE OLYMPIANS**

The twelve olympians are the twelvve major gods that all have thrones on the olympian counsel. They are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and either Hestia or Dionysus. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia and Demeter are children of Cronos and Rhea although Hades was never in the olympian counsel because he was to dark and everyone would be nervous. Hestia on the other hand gave her throne away to Dionysis when he became a god.

Zeus is the youngest child of Cronos and Rhea although unlike his brothers and sisters he was never swallowed by his father, Cronos. Zeus was raised by a goat named Amaltheia, in a mountain cave located in Crete where eventually Athena (one of Zeus’ children) would be brought up. Zeus had a lot of people in his family. Did you know everyone in the olympian counsel but Hephaestus? Zeus was the king of the gods but he often cheated on Hera alot of times. Zeus bore half the and Dionysis wasn’t born a god he was turned immortal so he technically is not a god.

**Poseidon**

Poseidon is the god of the sea. Poseidon has many nicknames including earth shaker and storm bringer. Poseidon is the second youngest son of Cronos and Rhea and was the last child to be swallowed by Cronos. After the war Zeus, Poseidon and Hades played paper, scisors, rock and Poseidon got the sea. Poseidon had a son called Triton and he had a horn that could calm the waves. When the cyclopes made Poseidon’s Trident he loved it. Amphitrite (Poseidon’s wife) was one of the 50 neirads and Poseidon’s favourite. Refusing his offer of marriage, she fled to Atlas, from whom she was retrieved by a dolphin sent by Poseidon. Amphitrite then returned, becoming Poseidon’s wife; he rewarded the dolphin by making it a constellation.

**Hades**

Hades is the oldest son of Cronos and Rhea and he was the gloomiest. Hades is the god of the underworld which means he lives alone exept for his wife, Persephone. Persephone is Demeter’s daughter by Zeus . Hades raped her with Zeus’ consent. Hades abducts Persephone when she is picking flowers in a meadow in the plain of Nysa. Hades arises through a chasm in the earth and takes her. Demeter, heartbroken and upset, asks Hecate and Helios, the sole witnesses of the rape, what has happened. Helios tells Demeter the name of Persephone’s abductor. Demeter shuns the gods and asks them for her daughter back. Zeus sends Hermes down to Hades to persuade him to release Persephone. Hades gives his bride some pomegranate seeds to eat, with the consequence that she must return. Demeter and Hades agree that Persephone will spend part of the year with her husband in the underworld and part of the year with her mother in the upper world. Sometimes when Persephone is in the world above even Hades gets bored and looks for river nympths to fall in love with.

**Hera**

Hera is the youngest daughter of Cronos and Rhea and is the most vengful. Hera became vengful when Zeus cheated on her after she finally maried him. The time Hera was most vengful is when she tried to kill Hercules. First, she used her supernatural powers to prevent the baby Hercules from becoming the ruler of Mycenae. Then, after Hercules was born, Hera sent two snakes to kill him in his crib. The infant Hercules was unusually strong and fearless, however, and he strangled the snakes before they could strangle him. But Hera kept up her dirty tricks. When her stepson was a young adult, she cast a kind of spell on him that drove him temporarily insane and caused him to murder his beloved wife and their two children. Guilty and heartbroken, Hercules tracked down Apollo, the god of truth and healing and begged to be punished for what he had done. Apollo understood that Hercules’ crime had not been his fault but still he insisted that the young man make amends. He ordered Hercules to perform 12 heroic labors for the Mycenaen king Eurystheus. Once Hercules completed every one of the labors, Apollo declared, he would be absolved of his guilt and achieve immortality. First, Apollo sent Hercules to the hills of Nemea to kill a lion that was terrorizing the people of the region. Hercules trapped the lion in its cave and strangled it. For the rest of his life, he wore the animal’s pelt as a cloak. Second, Hercules traveled to the city of Lerna to slay the nine-headed Hydra. For this task, Hercules had the help of his nephew Iolaus. He cut off each of the monster’s heads while Iolaus burned each wound with a torch. This way, the pair kept the heads from growing back. Next, Hercules set off to capture the sacred pet of the goddess Diana Eurystheus had chosen this task for his rival because he believed that Diana would kill anyone she caught trying to steal her pet; however, once Hercules explained his situation to the goddess, she allowed him to go on his way without punishment. Hercules had to do 9 heroic labors but thoose are the most interesting.

**Demeter**

Demeter is the Goddess of Farming. That may sound lame but she has some interesting stories. I have told you about the one about her daughter getting kidnaped but when Demeter wants to she can be as forceful as Hera. When Triptolemus taught King Lyncus of the Scythians, the arts of agriculture, Lyncus refused to teach it to his people and then tried to murder Triptolemus. As punishment, Demeter turned Lyncus into a lynx. King Charnabon of the Getae also made an attempt on Triptolemus’ life, killing one of his dragons to prevent his escape. Demeter intervened again, replacing the dragon and condemning Charnabon to a life of torment. Upon his death, Charnabon was placed in the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus, said to resemble a man trying to kill a serpent, as a warning to mortals who would think to betray those favoured by the gods.
