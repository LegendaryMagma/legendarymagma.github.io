### eSports CS:GO Looking  For Org (formerly [Dire Wolves](http://https://www.direwolves.gg/teams))
 
The roster was [acquired](https://twitter.com/DireWolves/status/1364738881384374274) by Dire Wolves earlier this year (2021) in February as part of the [takeover and merger](https://twitter.com/AvantGaming/status/1364477662761279488) of AVANT Gaming --- another Australian organization that hosted an earlier iteration of the roster since 2019. Since the acquisition, the squad has peaked at #74 in June on the HLTV.org global rankings, and as of the 23rd of August 2021, they sit at #4 in the Oceanic rankings behind Renegades, EXTREMUM, and ORDER. The most recent change that the roster experienced [dates back to July](https://twitter.com/DireWolves/status/1414845801474535424) with the departure of Jay "soju_j" Jeong and the addition of Mike "ap0c" Aliferis.

The most notable results for the side since they began representing Dire Wolves came in the form of back-to-back 1st place placements in seasons seven and eight of the LPL Pro League with grand final wins over both The Chiefs and Paradox respectively. The predominantly Australian line-up has also recently had a strong start to the ESEA Premier season, taking a 2-0 victory over Rooster in their opening fixture in Group A of the ANZ division of the competition. They also sit 3-0 in the Swiss stage of ESL ANZ Champs alongside ORDER going into Stage 2 as top seeds.

The roster as it will sit next month (2021):
