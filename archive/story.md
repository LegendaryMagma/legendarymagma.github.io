### ​​**The Curse of the Cursed Knife**

#### by LegendaryM

Whilst investigating the death of a local shopkeeper, a murderous hairdresser called Chloe Jones uncovers a legend about a supernaturally-cursed, cursed knife circulating throughout Scotland. As soon as anyone uses the knife, he or she has exactly 277 days left to live.

The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look translucent. A marked person feels like a scheming dog to touch.

Chloe gets hold of the knife, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into her mind: an icy badger balancing on a skinny shopkeeper, an old newspaper headline about a murder accident, a hooded lizard ranting about lips and a drinking well located in a noisy place.

When Chloe notices her hands have dog-like properties, she realizes that the curse of the cursed knife is true and calls in her lover, a police officer called Luke Rockatansky, to help.

Luke examines the knife and willingly submits himself to the curse. He finds that the same visions flash before his eyes. He finds the icy badger balancing on a skinny shopkeeper particularly chilling. He joins the queue for a supernatural death.

Chloe and Luke pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions, starting with a search for the hooded lizard. Will they be able to stop the curse before their time is up?
