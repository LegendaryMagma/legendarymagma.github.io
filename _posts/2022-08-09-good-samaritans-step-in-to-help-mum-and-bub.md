The mother who pulled her unconscious son from a car and cradled him on a busy north-west Melbourne roadside has been reunited with the good Samaritan couple who rushed to help her.

Key points:
-----------

-   Madeleine Crawford's child had a seizure on the way to hospital on August 3
-   Thi and Cindy Le assisted in getting him there but the group did not exchange details
-   They were all reunited after Ms Crawford put the call out through ABC Radio Melbourne

Madeleine Crawford, and 20-month-old Stirling, met Thi and Cindy Le of North Sunshine at an emotional weekend reunion.

It was the first time they had come together since Ms Crawford put out a call to find them so she could finally say thank you.

Suffering a fever, chesty cough and struggling to breathe, Stirling was being driven by Ms Crawford to the Royal Children's Hospital emergency department on August 3 when he started having a seizure in the back seat.

A clean bill of health
----------------------

While the car was stopped at the intersection of Churchill Avenue waiting to turn right into Ballarat Road at Maidstone, Ms Crawford noticed her son having a seizure in the rear-view mirror. She immediately got out of the car and pulled the toddler from the back seat.

Sitting in the car behind as the situation unfolded, Ms Le and her husband jumped from their vehicle to help.

"I immediately knew something was wrong," she said.

> "I didn't know what else to do so I told Madeleine I'd hold baby Stirling while she drives to the closest hospital.

"Thankfully my husband was a quick thinker and drove in front with hazard lights on to escort us to the hospital safely."

They made it to Footscray Hospital where Ms Crawford ran inside and Stirling was immediately triaged by the nurses.

Reunited via radio
------------------

There was no time to exchange details.

Ms Le said when the pair arrived home, she could not stop thinking about what had happened.

"As a mother myself, I knew how distressing it would've been to have experienced that," she said.

> "But I never would have thought Madeleine would try to find us. I just did what I could at the time to help."

"It was incredible to be able to express our gratitude in person," Ms Crawford said.

"It was a very special afternoon --- lots of hugs and smiles."

A clean bill of health
----------------------

Stirling was diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus but has since been issued a clean bill of health.

Ms Crawford said it was his seizure that had caught her off guard and urged other parents to learn how to respond to a similar situation.

In a twist, the Le family revealed their own granddaughter, Aria, had been through a similar experience only months ago.

Their daughter, Anita, had phoned them for help after her sick toddler started having a seizure.

According to the Victorian government, about one in every 20 children between six months and six years old will experience a febrile seizure while suffering a high fever. While alarming, it is not epilepsy and it does not cause brain damage. 

> "It is absolutely terrifying if it happens to your child," Ms Crawford said.

"I would recommend parents read the guidance so they can be as prepared as they can if or when it happens."
