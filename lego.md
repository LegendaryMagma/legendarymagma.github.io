**operating manual for your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender**

This page includes the missing operating instructions for your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender that Lego doesn't make!

N.B. Your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender works amazingly well considering all parts are made of plastic however in some operational states the forces are too great so their will be slippage causing a clicking sound.  Because of the limits of plastic component lego this is just the way it is.  Try turning the stearing wheel and you get a sense that the components are at there limits of maintaining their rigidity and not flexing too much at their extreme positions.

**Operational States**
Range - high or low --> operated by right shifter
Drive - forward or neutral or reverse --> operated by left shifter
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low, low, high, extra high) --> operated by gear selection wheel that moves clockwise to select low gear and anti-clockwise to select high gear

Your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender has a fake engine.  The fake engine pistons move up and down in a cool sequence when your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender is pushed along the ground.

Your results may vary however in our tests we found that the fake engine pistons worked most consistently in the following operation states.  

**Forward Drive**
Range - low 
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low or low) 
**Reverse Drive**
Range - low 
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low or low) 


The fake engine pistons do not move up and down in a cool sequence when your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender is in Neutral Drive regardless of whether it is pushed along the ground.  Of course if a real landrover defender with engine on will have the engine parts moving even when in Neutral Drive.
