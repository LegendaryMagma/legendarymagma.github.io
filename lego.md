**operating manual for your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender**

This page includes brief operating instructions for your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender and should help manage your expectations about how it works.

Your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender works amazingly well considering all parts are made of plastic. There are some operational states where the forces are too great for the plastic components. There will likely be gear slippage and a clicking sound if the forces are too great for the plastic components. For example,  turn the stearing wheel to the limits and you get a sense that the components are remaining rigid and are flexing too much. 

**Operational States**
Range - high or low --> operated by right shifter
Drive - forward or neutral or reverse --> operated by left shifter
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low, low, high, extra high) --> operated by gear selection wheel that moves clockwise to select low gear and anti-clockwise to select high gear

Your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender has a fake engine.  The fake engine pistons move up and down in a cool sequence when your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender is pushed along the ground.

Your results may vary, however in our tests we found that the fake engine pistons worked most consistently in the following operation states.  

**Forward Drive**  
Range - low 
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low or low) 
**Reverse Drive**  
Range - low 
Gear Selection - four positions (extra low or low) 


The fake engine pistons do not move up and down in a cool sequence when your lego-technic-42110-land-rover-defender is in Neutral Drive regardless of whether it is pushed along the ground.  Of course if a real landrover defender with engine on will have the engine parts moving even when in Neutral Drive.
